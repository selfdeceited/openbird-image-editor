 - [ ] do the 'two-stage' edit: raw image by wasm and later canvas manipulations
  Raw image changes will be passed to state as byte array directly on each e.g. brighness adjsustment. The canvas changes will be preserved as the set of pre-selected edits (redux?) to be applied afterwards.

 - [ ] contrast adjustment
 - [ ] drag-and-drop cropped area
