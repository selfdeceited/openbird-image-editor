### RAW image editor for bird photography

A simple editor based on libraw wasm bindings can be a lightweight all-in-one place to preserve your image details from RAW format while doing based image manipulation, such as crop, rotate, signature adding and metadata fixes, such as datetime, location, etc.

Further on it can automatically upload it to the cloud storage with eBird integration, automatic gallery, statistics, etc.

There are tools to do each part of this way better, but I personally need it all in one place, at one window, web-based and free, so that's why it exists.
